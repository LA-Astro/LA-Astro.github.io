Many astrophysical explosions are preceded by periods of low speed
convection, including the single degenerate models of Type Ia
supernovae and X-ray bursts.  Capturing the dynamics of these flows is
challenging for traditional hydrodynamics codes, but it is these
phases that set the initial conditions for the subsequent explosion.
We described the status of the low Mach number hydrodynamics code,
Maestro, developed to model these phases of evolution efficiently.  We
show applications to the convective phase in the Chandrasekhar-mass
model of Type Ia supernovae, convection in the helium layer on
sub-Chandra mass white dwarfs, and burning in mixed H/He layers on
neutron stars (X-ray bursts), and discuss the influence of the
convection on the final explosion.  With simulation codes becoming
increasingly complex, we discuss the need for community involvement
and outline some potential future applications and developments of
this simulation methodology.
